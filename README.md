Project Title: Redesigned Portfolio with Next.js, TypeScript, and Prisma

Description:

Welcome to my portfolio project, where I’ve completely revamped my personal website using cutting-edge technologies for a seamless and efficient user experience. This project utilizes Next.js, TypeScript, and Prisma to create a high-performance and reliable web application that showcases my skills and projects.

Key Features:

	1.	Next.js for SSR and CSR: By employing Next.js, this portfolio leverages the power of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Client-Side Rendering (CSR). SSR ensures fast initial loading and improved SEO, while CSR optimizes navigation speed by fetching data on-demand.
	2.	TypeScript for Type Safety: TypeScript enhances code quality and maintainability by providing strong typing. It catches errors at build time, reducing runtime issues and improving the development process.
	3.	Prisma for Data Management: Prisma is used as the data layer, offering a modern and developer-friendly database toolkit. It ensures efficient data management and easy integration with your projects and achievements.
	4.	Responsive Design: The portfolio is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring an excellent user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
	5.	Optimized Performance: I’ve paid great attention to optimizing the performance of the website. It loads quickly, ensuring visitors have a smooth and engaging experience.
	6.	Interactive UI: The user interface is designed to be visually appealing and interactive, providing an engaging and informative experience for visitors.
	7.	Project Showcase: You can find details about my projects, skills, and experience, allowing visitors to explore my work and expertise.
